                <p>Edo State, created on August 27, 1991, is located in southern Nigeria with Benin City as its capital. It was part of the former Bendel State before the split into Edo and Delta States.
                  The state is the historic home of the Benin Kingdom, one of Africa’s oldest and most advanced civilizations, known for its bronzes, strong monarchy, and city walls. The kingdom dates back to around the 11th century and was led by the Oba of Benin.
                 Edo State is mainly inhabited by the Edo (Bini), Esan, Owan, and Etsako people. It remains culturally rich and historically significant in Nigeria.</P>
